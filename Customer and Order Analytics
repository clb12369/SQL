# This SQL project utilizes a database containing multiple tables with customer and order data

SELECT
COUNT(orderID)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

# 2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 

SELECT
COUNT(orderID) as iphone_sales 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE PRODUCT = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

# 3. What are the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 

SELECT DISTINCT
customers.acctnum
FROM customers
INNER JOIN FebSales ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

# 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
#  Two ways:

SELECT
Product,
price

ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

SELECT DISTINCT

price
FROM JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT MIN(price) FROM JanSales);

# 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 

SELECT
Product,
SUM(Quantity) * price AS product_revenue
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

# 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each and total revenue?

SELECT
Product,
SUM(quantity) AS no_of_items,

WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

# 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February and what was the average amount spent for each? 

SELECT
COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum),
AVG(Quantity * price)
FROM FebSales AS feb
LEFT JOIN customers AS cust

AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
